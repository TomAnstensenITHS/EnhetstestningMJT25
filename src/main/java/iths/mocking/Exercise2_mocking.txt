The purpose of this exercise is to mock the Userservice.java file.

1. Create a test class.
2. Write a test that
    - Sets up a mock userRepository
    - Sets up a mock userService
    - Creates a new user with an 'id' and a 'name'
    - Updates the users name to a new one
    - Asserts that the user has the new name

3. Try to add the when().thenReturn() and verify() methods to see the different outputs.
